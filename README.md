## âœ¨ Core Features

- **Smart Contracts (`/contracts`):**
  - **Factory Pattern:** A main `StockMarket.sol` contract deploys unique ERC20 `StockToken.sol` contracts for each new stock.
  - **Oracle Integration:** Uses Chainlink Any API to fetch real-time stock prices from an external source.
  - **Secure:** Leverages OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` for access control on admin functions.
- **User Interface (`/ui`):**
  - **Responsive Design:** Modern, glassy, space-themed UI that works on both desktop and mobile.
  - **Web3 Connectivity:** Connects to user's MetaMask wallet to interact with the blockchain.
  - **Full Functionality:** Supports all contract features, including owner-only admin panels and a user-facing modal for buying and selling tokens.
  - **Rich UX:** Includes loading states, transaction notifications, and proactive warnings for outdated prices.
