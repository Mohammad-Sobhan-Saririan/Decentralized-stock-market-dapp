# üöÄ Decentralized Stock Market dApp

Welcome to our **Decentralized Stock Market**, a full-stack decentralized application (dApp) that brings the thrill of stock trading to the Ethereum blockchain! Deployed on the Sepolia testnet, this project combines robust Solidity smart contracts, real-time price feeds via Chainlink oracles, and a sleek, user-friendly React frontend. Whether you're a blockchain developer or just curious, this dApp showcases how to bridge real-world data with on-chain logic in a secure and interactive way.

## üåü What Makes This Project Awesome?

This dApp lets users buy and sell tokenized stocks (ERC20 tokens) using LINK as the payment currency, built for our *Fundamentals of Cryptocurrencies* course. It‚Äôs packed with features that make it both functional and fun to explore:

- **Smart Contracts (`/contracts`):**
  - **Factory Pattern Magic:** The `StockMarket.sol` contract dynamically deploys unique `StockToken.sol` ERC20 contracts for each stock (e.g., Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúGOOGL‚Äù).
  - **Real-Time Price Feeds:** Integrates Chainlink‚Äôs Any API (Job ID: `0x73744237c569436394553b9a76de202f`) to fetch live stock prices from Alphavantage, with a 0.1 LINK fee per request.
  - **Secure Design:** Uses OpenZeppelin‚Äôs `Ownable` for admin-only controls and the CEI (Check-Effects-Interactions) pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks.
  - **Price Timeout:** Enforces a configurable validity period (default: 3600 seconds) to ensure trades use fresh prices.

- **Frontend (`/ui`):**
  - **Stellar UI Design:** A modern, glassy, space-themed interface with the custom Panton font, fully responsive for desktop and mobile.
  - **Web3 Integration:** Connects to MetaMask for wallet interactions, showing your address, LINK balance, and stock holdings.
  - **Rich Features:** Includes an admin panel for owners to add stocks and request price updates, plus a modal for buying/selling with react-toastify notifications.
  - **User-Friendly Touches:** Copy-to-clipboard buttons for addresses, tooltips, and warnings for outdated prices to enhance the experience.

- **Payment Token:** Uses LINK (`0x779877A7B0D9E8603169DdbD7836e478b4624789` on Sepolia) for both oracle fees and trading, ensuring seamless integration with Chainlink and ERC20 compatibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

  - **React + Vite**: For a fast, modern UI development experience.
  - **ethers.js**: For seamless blockchain interactions.
  - **react-toastify**: For sleek transaction notifications.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: For styling with a glassy, space-themed aesthetic.
- **Tools:**
  - **Remix IDE**: For contract development and deployment.
  - **MetaMask**: For wallet integration and Sepolia interactions.
  - **Etherscan**: For transaction verification and debugging.
  - **Infura**: For reliable RPC endpoints.

## ‚ú® Core Features in Action

Here‚Äôs what you can do with this dApp:

- **Add Stocks (Admin):** Owners can add new stocks (e.g., ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù with symbol ‚ÄúGOOGL‚Äù), deploying a new ERC20 token contract.
- **Fetch Real-Time Prices:** Owners trigger price updates via Chainlink, storing prices and timestamps on-chain.
- **Buy & Sell Stocks:** Users trade tokenized stocks with LINK using secure approve/transferFrom mechanics.
- **View Portfolio:** The UI shows your wallet address, LINK balance, stock holdings, and details like price and last update.
- **Stay Secure:** Admin functions are owner-only, and trades are blocked if prices are outdated.

## üß™ Testing the dApp

We thoroughly tested the dApp on Sepolia to ensure rock-solid functionality. Here‚Äôs how we validated it:

1. **Funded the Contract with LINK:**
   - Copied the `StockMarket` contract address from Remix.
   - Sent 1 LINK to it via MetaMask (LINK address: `0x779877A7B0D9E8603169DdbD7836e478b4624789`).
   - Verified the 1 LINK balance on Etherscan‚Äôs ‚ÄúTokens‚Äù tab.

2. **Configured Contract Settings:**
   - Set `setPaymentToken` with the LINK address to use it for trades.
   - Configured `setChainlinkDetails` with Job ID `0x73744237c569436394553b9a76de202f` and a 0.1 LINK fee.
   - Confirmed transactions on Etherscan with ‚ÄúContract Call‚Äù entries.

3. **Added a Stock:**
   - Called `addStock` with ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù and ‚ÄúGOOGL‚Äù to deploy a `StockToken` contract.
   - Found the `StockAdded` event in Remix logs, copied the new token address, and verified it on Etherscan.

4. **Requested & Verified Price Updates:**
   - Called `requestPriceUpdate` for ‚ÄúGOOGL‚Äù, deducting 0.1 LINK (confirmed on Etherscan).
   - After 1-2 minutes, checked the `stocks` mapping in Remix, confirming a non-zero price (8 decimals) and recent timestamp.

5. **Bought & Sold Stocks:**
   - **Buy:** Approved 10 LINK for `StockMarket` via the LINK contract‚Äôs `approve`, then called `buyStock` for 1 GOOGL. MetaMask showed LINK deducted and GOOGL added.
   - **Sell:** Approved 1 GOOGL token, then called `sellStock`. MetaMask showed GOOGL removed and LINK returned.
   - Etherscan logs showed `PriceUpdated` events and token transfers.

These tests confirmed that our dApp meets all requirements, from contract logic to real-world interactions.
